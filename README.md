## üöÄ Features

- Powered by Groq LLMs: Choose from top-tier models like llama-3.3-70b-versatile, deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b, and gemma2-9b-it for reliable and intelligent responses.

- Medical Expertise: The chatbot is trained and fine-tuned on health-focused dataset (PDF) to provide expert-level information.

- Real-Time Responses: Ask your medical questions and get immediate, contextual answers powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

- Custom Model Selection: Flexibility to switch between Groq models as per your performance or accuracy needs.

- Chat History: Keeps track of your previous conversations for seamless user experience.

- Interactive Streamlit Interface: A clean, responsive UI for hassle-free interaction.

## üß† How It Works

- Data Extraction: PDF files are loaded using PyPDFLoader, then split into manageable text chunks using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.

- Embedding Generation: Chunks are embedded using Hugging Face's all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model.

- Vector Indexing: Chunks are stored in a FAISS vector index for fast similarity search.

- Query Retrieval: On user query, relevant document chunks are retrieved using a custom FAISS retriever.

- Answer Generation: Groq LLMs process the context and generate a concise, helpful response.
